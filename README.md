# WorkingWithDictionaries
You are to write a C++ program to implement a spelling checker. 

The program will first build a dictionary of correctly spelled words by reading the words from the files dict.txt and mydict.txt in the current directory. It will then ask the user for the name of a text file to spell check. The program must print to standard output a list of misspelled words and the line numbers on which they occur. Also, for each misspelled word, list any words in the dictionary that are obtainable by applying any of the following rules:
1. Add one letter to the word (at any position)
2. Remove one letter from the word
3. Exchange adjacent characters

Note that line numbers must begin with 1 for the first line in the file. You are determining what the interface of this program looks like, but you will be evaluated partially on the quality of the interface. Make sure that your output is clear and clean. Overly wordy output is just as bad as cryptic output. Do make sure you spell well – this is a spelling checker, after all.
